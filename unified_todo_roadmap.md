# Unified Quantitative Trading System TODO List

Based on analysis of `vision.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `tooly.md`, `enhanced_system_roadmap.md`, and `learnings.md`, here's the comprehensive structured TODO list:

## ⚠️ CURRENT STATUS SNAPSHOT

### Infrastructure & MCP Servers
- ⚠️ **MCP Registry Implementation** – Registry exists but many registered tools remain stubs or demos; needs end-to-end validation before calling complete.
- ⚠️ **Core MCP Servers** – 14 servers present, yet several (compliance, risk, quantconnect, semtools) still rely on fallbacks/mocks. Production readiness unproven.
- ❌ **Test Infrastructure** – Current suite covers only a handful of shell/resilience cases; critical agents/portfolio/QC flows lack automated tests.
- ⚠️ **Basic Tool Schemas** – Schemas defined, but not consistently enforced against live inputs/outputs.
- ⚠️ **GitHub Workflows** – CI runs but omits integration/backtest/coverage checks; needs substantial expansion.

### Mathematical Foundation
- ⚠️ **Hidden Markov Model Integration** – Utility exists but unvalidated on real data and not wired into workflows.
- ⚠️ **Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Mean Reversion** – Implementation present; requires real-data testing and integration.
- ⚠️ **Signal Processing Suite** – Fourier/wavelet/filter tools functional in isolation; not yet used by agents.
- ⚠️ **Advanced Signal Filtering** – Adaptive filter implemented; needs live validation and agent adoption.
- ⚠️ **Provenance System** – Signing/persistence exists but stores keys/db locally and operates in mock mode without crypto; hardening required.

### Multi-Agent AI (Phase 3: IN PROGRESS)
- ⚠️ **TradingAgents Framework** – Base classes and orchestrator exist, but current runs rely on mock data/agents.
- ⚠️ **Fundamental/Technical/Sentiment/Quantitative Agents** – Implementations output deterministic synthetic data; real market integration outstanding.
- ⚠️ **Resilience Framework** – Circuit breaker utilities exist; only sporadically applied and untested under load.

## 🚧 IN PROGRESS TASKS

### Phase 4: Performance Optimization (Weeks 25-32)
- ❌ **Continuous Batching Implementation** – Not started.
- ❌ **Multi-Tier Caching Architecture** – Not started.

## 📋 PENDING TASKS BY PRIORITY

### HIGH PRIORITY (Critical Path)

#### Phase 4: Performance Optimization (Weeks 25-32)
- ❌ **Real-Time Streaming Pipeline** – No implementation or dependencies present.
- ❌ **Parallel Execution Optimization** – No concurrency framework beyond placeholders.
- ❌ **Token Usage Optimization** – No KV caching/quantization work in codebase.
- ❌ **Performance Monitoring** – No tracing/metrics instrumentation.

#### Phase 5: Advanced Analytics (Weeks 33-40)
- ⚠️ **Hierarchical Risk Parity** – Portfolio engine includes placeholder HRP; requires real data + validation.
- ⚠️ **Black-Litterman Enhancement** – Stubs present; lacks agent view integration/tests.
- ❌ **Regulatory Compliance** – Compliance pipeline not wired into execution; automation absent.
- ❌ **Production Monitoring** – No observability tooling.

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (Performance & Infrastructure)

#### Phase 4: Performance Optimization (Weeks 25-32)
- ❌ **Continuous Batching** – Not started.
- ❌ **Multi-Tier Caching** – Not started.
- ❌ **Real-Time Streaming** – Not started.
- ❌ **Parallel Execution** – Not started.

#### Phase 5: Advanced Analytics (Weeks 33-40)
- ⚠️ **Hierarchical Risk Parity** – Needs real factor data + testing.
- ⚠️ **Black-Litterman Enhancement** – Needs agent integration + validation.
- ❌ **Regulatory Compliance** – Automation pending.
- ❌ **Production Monitoring** – Not started.

#### Phase 7: Tool Enhancement (Weeks 37-44)
- ⚠️ **Circuit Breaker Patterns** – Utilities exist; broad adoption/testing missing.
- ❌ **Advanced Observability** – No tracing implementation.
- ❌ **Token Usage Optimization** – No progress.
- ⚠️ **Semtools Integration** – Server present; lacks hardened CLI integration/testing.

### LOWER PRIORITY (Advanced Features)

- ❌ **Quantum Computing Prep** – Not started.
- ❌ **Neuromorphic Processing** – Not started.
- ❌ **Web3 Integration** – Not started.
- ❌ **Blockchain Analytics** – Not started.

#### Infrastructure Hardening
- ❌ **Security Enhancement** – No evidence of audits or pentests.
- ❌ **Disaster Recovery** – No backup strategy implemented.
- ❌ **Compliance Automation** – Pipeline not productionized.
- ❌ **Performance Monitoring** – No SLA dashboards.

## 📊 EXECUTION ROADMAP GATES

- **Phase 1 Gate**: Not validated – no accuracy/benchmark metrics captured.
- **Phase 2 Gate**: Not started – alternative data streams absent.
- **Phase 3 Gate**: ❌ Not yet achieved – multi-agent orchestration still mock-based.
- **Phase 4 Gate**: Pending – performance work unstarted.
- **Phase 5 Gate**: Pending – compliance automation unimplemented.
- **Phase 6 Gate**: Pending – emerging tech unaddressed.

### Resource Requirements
- **Personnel**: $1.08M annually (5 specialists)
- **Infrastructure**: $750K annually (cloud, data, licenses)
- **Total Budget**: $1.83M annually

- **Sharpe Ratio / Drawdown / Latency / Uptime** – No measurement infrastructure; targets remain aspirational.

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE NEXT ACTIONS (Week 1-2)

1. **Deploy Circuit Breakers** – Utilities exist; apply across MCP servers and verify.
2. **Integrate Semtools** – Harden CLI invocation and add regression tests.
3. **Optimize Caching** – Work not started; define architecture before claiming progress.
4. **Setup Observability** – Implement basic metrics/tracing to track progress against vision.

## 📈 SUCCESS METRICS & VALIDATION
