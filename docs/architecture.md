# Architecture Blueprint

## 1. Layered Overview
- **Presentation & Oversight Layer**: Human dashboards, Alpha Council review portal, documentation viewers.
- **Agent Orchestration Layer**: Meta-Supervisor (LangGraph/CrewAI), role-specific agents (Strategy Lab, Data Edge, Execution Ops, Risk Sentinel, Compliance Guardian, Security Watch, QA/Test Architect, Ops/SRE) managed via BMad workflows.
- **Tooling & Integration Layer**: MCP registry, semtools semantic router, tool metadata store, provenance ledger API, experiment tracker, QA automation.
- **Data & Compute Layer**: Real market/alt data ingestion, knowledge graph, feature store, QuantConnect Lean Docker cluster, colocation execution nodes, secrets vault, observability stack.

## 2. Agent Ecosystem
- **Meta-Supervisor**: Orchestrates planning, debate, and execution cycles; enforces BMad stage gates and compliance checkpoints.
- **Strategy Lab Agents**: Generate hypotheses from knowledge graph and expert council notes; interact with data tools, feature calculators, and Lean backtesting MCP.
- **Data Edge Agent**: Manages ingestion pipelines, QC scoring, anomaly detection, vendor reconciliation, provenance updates.
- **Execution Ops Agent**: Coordinates smart order routing, latency monitoring, TCA ingestion from live/paper trading runs.
- **Risk Sentinel**: Evaluates strategies against VaR/CVaR, liquidity, concentration limits, historical crisis scenarios.
- **Compliance Guardian**: Checks regulatory mappings, audit trail completeness, reporting requirements.
- **Security Watch**: Detects prompt injection, anomalous tool behavior, credential abuse; works with zero-trust infrastructure.
- **QA/Test Architect**: Runs BMad QA macros, ensures coverage, NFR validation, regression risk analysis.
- **Ops/SRE Agent**: Monitors MCP/semtools health, cost budgets, infrastructure telemetry; triggers incident response.

## 3. Tooling Architecture
- **MCP Registry**
  - Namespace structure: `market-data.*`, `altdata.*`, `feature-engineering.*`, `strategy.eval`, `execution.*`, `risk.*`, `compliance.*`, `qa.*`, `ops.*`.
  - Every tool: versioned schema, detailed description, parameter typing, verbosity controls, signed responses.
- **semtools Router**
  - Dual embedding indexes (finance-domain model, general model).
  - Metadata includes cost, latency, provenance requirements, freshness timestamp.
  - Rejection sampling + human escalation for low-confidence selections.
- **Workflow Engine**
  - LangGraph/CrewAI hybrid for deterministic paths: research planning → QA risk design → development → validation → compliance review → deployment.
  - AlphaEvolve evolutionary scheduler integrates with Meta-Supervisor to mutate prompts/tool chains and re-run competitions.

## 4. Data Architecture
- **Ingestion Pipelines**
  - Modular ETL jobs for exchanges, fundamentals, regulatory, alternative sensors, expert transcripts.
  - Validation steps: schema enforcement, checksum verification, cross-vendor comparison, anomaly alerts.
- **Provenance Ledger**
  - Append-only store (e.g., immutability via ledger DB) capturing source IDs, timestamps, QC metrics, validation notes, hash of raw files.
  - MCP access tool for agents/humans to query provenance records.
- **Knowledge Graph**
  - Entities: companies, venues, instruments, economic events, supply-chain links, regulatory bodies.
  - Relations based on real data (filings, shipments, energy usage, inspections).
- **Feature Store**
  - Only derived from verified datasets; versioned; tracks transformations; supports reproducible backtesting.
- **Compute**
  - Research cluster (cloud GPUs/CPUs) for feature engineering & modeling.
  - Lean Docker cluster orchestrated via Kubernetes or equivalent; secrets injected at runtime.
  - Colocation nodes for low-latency execution; telemetry piped back to observability stack.

## 5. Backtesting & Experimentation
- **Lean Integration**
  - Dockerized CLI commands wrapped in MCP tool (`strategy.eval.run_backtest`).
  - Config templates stored in repo; runtime uses secure env vars for credentials.
  - Outputs (equity curve, statistics, logs) stored in experiment tracker with provenance links.
- **Validation Pipeline**
  - Automated sequence: data integrity check → training/backtest (Lean) → statistical analysis (Sharpe, Calmar, drawdown) → factor exposure comparison → embargoed forward walk (Lean live/paper) → human review.
  - QA agent runs `*trace`, `*nfr`, `*review` macros at each stage.

## 6. Security & Compliance Design
- **Zero-Trust Controls**
  - Hardware-backed secrets (e.g., HSM or cloud KMS) for QuantConnect token and vendor keys.
  - Token vault with per-agent scoped credentials; short TTL.
  - Mutual TLS / signed payloads for MCP responses.
- **Monitoring**
  - SIEM ingesting logs from agents, MCP, network, Lean cluster.
  - Security Watch agent uses threat intelligence to flag anomalies.
- **Compliance Automation**
  - Mapping matrix linking requirements (Reg SCI, MiFID II, CAT, GDPR) to implemented controls.
  - Automated report generators that pull from provenance ledger, trade logs, QA gates.

## 7. Observability & Ops
- **Telemetry**: Prometheus/Grafana or cloud equivalents collecting metrics for data pipelines, Lean jobs, agent activity, execution latency.
- **Incident Response**: Playbooks stored in docs/runbooks/, triggered via Ops agent, integrated with paging/alerting.
- **Cost Management**: Budget governance tool reading API usage, compute cost; enforces throttles and approval workflows.

## 8. Evolution & Scalability
- Phased rollout: equities universe baseline → add sectors/regions → introduce derivatives once validated.
- Adversarial mirror agents simulate sophisticated competitors using real trade data to identify vulnerabilities.
- Continuous embedding retraining and tool metadata refresh ensure semtools routing stays accurate.

## 9. Open Architecture Questions
- Preferred ledger technology for provenance (e.g., immudb vs. append-only SQL)?
- Target orchestration platform for Lean Docker cluster (Kubernetes, Nomad, managed service)?
- Data residency requirements influencing storage choices?
