# Product Requirements Document: Agentic Quant Platform

## 1. Overview
- **Product Name**: World-Class Agentic Quantitative Trading Platform
- **Owner**: Human Alpha Council (sponsor: user)
- **Vision Alignment**: Builds institutional-grade, real-data-only trading agents leveraging MCP tooling, semtools routing, AlphaEvolve-style evolution, and BMad governance to deliver 10+ years of verifiable alpha via QuantConnect Lean.
- **Problem**: Existing agentic quant systems rely on synthetic data or brittle workflows, leading to unreliable alpha and compliance gaps.
- **Opportunity**: Combine cutting-edge AI orchestration with rigorous finance controls to discover and execute legitimate strategies verified against real market history.

## 2. Goals & KPIs
- **G1**: Deliver reproducible Lean backtests with >1.5 Sharpe and positive Calmar over 10-year horizon using real data only.
  - *KPI*: Rolling 3-year Sharpe > 1.3, max drawdown < 20%, annualized return > 15%.
- **G2**: Ensure complete provenance for every dataset, tool call, and strategic decision.
  - *KPI*: 100% of records in provenance ledger linked to source IDs and QC scores.
- **G3**: Maintain regulatory and security compliance for live deployment readiness.
  - *KPI*: Zero critical compliance audit findings; incident MTTR < 30 minutes.
- **G4**: Support continuous alpha innovation through evolutionary agent competitions.
  - *KPI*: At least one new candidate strategy per month passing validation gates.

## 3. Non-Goals
- Synthetic data generation, simulated fills, or unverifiable claims.
- Supporting asset classes without reliable data sources in the current phase.
- Building bespoke broker execution until post paper-trading validation.

## 4. Functional Requirements
1. **Data Acquisition & Management**
   - Real-time and historical ingestion from vetted providers (exchanges, regulatory filings, IoT, shipping, energy, expert transcripts).
   - Provenance ledger storing source details, timestamps, QC metrics, validation notes.
   - Knowledge graph connecting entities, events, and relationships for reasoning.
2. **Tooling & Orchestration**
   - MCP registry with namespaced, versioned tool schemas for data, research, risk, execution, compliance, QA, ops.
   - semtools-based semantic routing with dual embeddings, metadata audits, rejection sampling.
   - LangGraph/CrewAI-style deterministic workflows enabling debate, critique, and role-based governance.
3. **Research & Strategy Evolution**
   - AlphaEvolve-inspired evolutionary loops generating, mutating, and evaluating strategies based on real data features.
   - Integration with QuantConnect Lean Docker CLI for backtesting and forward-walk validation.
   - Experiment tracker capturing configs, metrics, Git SHAs, and approvals.
4. **Execution & Risk**
   - Smart order routing MCP interface with latency budgets, venue scoring, and TCA feedback.
   - Risk Sentinel enforcing VaR/CVaR, exposure limits, liquidity constraints using historical stress events.
   - Kill switches, circuit breakers, and escalation protocols tied to human oversight.
5. **Compliance & Security**
   - Mapping to Reg SCI, MiFID II, CAT, GDPR/CCPA obligations.
   - Zero-trust architecture: RBAC, hardware secrets, signed tool responses, prompt-injection detection.
   - Audit logging with tamper-evident storage and retrieval tools.
6. **Human Oversight & UX**
   - Alpha Council review dashboards showing agent reasoning traces, data evidence, validation results.
   - Documentation agents maintaining living runbooks, change logs, risk registers.

## 5. User Stories
- **Quant Researcher**: As a researcher, I submit a new strategy hypothesis grounded in the knowledge graph and receive validation, provenance, and Lean backtest results automatically.
- **Risk Officer**: As risk management, I review VaR/CVaR outputs and historical stress tests before approving capital allocation.
- **Compliance Lead**: As compliance, I audit trade recommendations with traceable data sources and regulatory mapping.
- **SRE Lead**: As operations, I monitor MCP health, cost budgets, and incident response, receiving alerts when tooling drifts.
- **Human Alpha Council Member**: I review complete narratives of agent decisions, data citations, and validation metrics before issuing go/no-go.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime for core MCP services; automated failover within 5 minutes.
- **Security**: Secrets stored in hardware-backed vault; all inter-service comms encrypted and signed.
- **Performance**: Research workflows return preliminary results < 2 hours; execution routing latency < 5ms at colocation.
- **Scalability**: Able to support 5x data volume and strategy count without re-architecture.
- **Observability**: Full telemetry (metrics, logs, traces) with dashboards and alert thresholds.

## 7. Dependencies & Assumptions
- Access to QuantConnect Lean Docker environment with provided credentials (managed securely via vault/secrets).
- Availability of data vendor APIs with contractual SLAs.
- Dedicated security/compliance review resources.
- Budget for colocation and cloud research clusters.

## 8. Risks & Mitigations
- **Data quality issues**: Multi-vendor redundancy, automated anomaly detection, expert review gates.
- **Overfitting**: Strict validation pipeline, embargoed splits, statistical corrections, human audit.
- **Operational complexity**: SRE team, automation, documentation agents, phased rollout.
- **Compliance gaps**: Early legal/compliance engagement, mapped controls, audit-ready logs.
- **Security threats**: Zero-trust design, red-team drills, continuous monitoring.

## 9. Milestones
1. Planning complete with BMad artifacts.
2. Data ingestion + provenance ledger MVP.
3. MCP/semtools framework live with core tools.
4. Lean backtesting pipeline operational.
5. Evolutionary strategy engine producing validated candidates.
6. Paper trading with live monitoring.
7. Production readiness review.

## 10. Open Questions
- Which exchanges and alternative data vendors are prioritized for phase 1?
- What capital allocation and risk budgets will the human council approve initially?
- How will expert council inputs be sourced and refreshed?
