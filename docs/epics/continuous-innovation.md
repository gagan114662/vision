# Epic: Continuous Innovation & Research Ops
- Aligns with PRD Goals G1, G4
- Owner: Innovation Scout Agent / Meta-Supervisor

## Purpose
Establish a self-improving research pipeline that continuously ingests external advancements (academic papers, open-source projects, quant forums) and safely integrates validated improvements into the platform.

## Stories
1. **Research Feed Aggregator**: Build agents/resources that monitor curated sources (MQL5 research, GitHub repos like options-implied-probability, Alibaba DeepResearch) and store structured summaries with provenance.
2. **Innovation Review Workflow**: Create LangGraph workflow where Innovation Scout proposes upgrades, Strategy Lab validates, Risk/Compliance review impact, and Meta-Supervisor schedules implementation.
3. **Lean Reliability Guardrails**: Implement CI tasks for Lean compilation/backtest dry-runs with artifact caching and failure signature alerts to reduce operational friction.
4. **Knowledge Base Update Bot**: Automate documentation and MCP registry updates when new tools or methods are accepted, including QA gate triggers.
5. **Impact Metrics Dashboard**: Track adoption rate, performance impact, and reliability improvements from integrated innovations.
