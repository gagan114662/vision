| `quantconnect.project.sync` | Project + File Tools | Full project CRUD, file management |
| `quantconnect.backtest.run` | Backtest Tools | Create, monitor, analyze backtests |
| `quantconnect.backtest.status` | Backtest Tools | Detailed status, logs, performance |

### Configuration Requirements

1. **Environment Variables** (already documented):
   ```bash
   export QC_MCP_USER_ID="357130"
   export QC_MCP_API_TOKEN="c57de4d0a52c62895013a7d06258b42a567767fa2aadaf53144e87884f34ac68"
   ```

2. **Server Launch**:
   ```bash
   cd integrations/quantconnect_mcp/vendor
   python3 -m src.main
   ```

3. **Dependencies** (install in virtual environment):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -e .
   ```

## üèóÔ∏è Integration Architecture

### Replace Stub Implementations

Our current stub server (`mcp/servers/quantconnect_stub.py`) can be replaced with connections to the real QuantConnect MCP server:

```python
# Before (Stub Implementation)
class QuantConnectStubServer:
    def project_sync(self, request):
        return {"status": "stub_implementation"}

# After (Real MCP Integration)
class QuantConnectMCPClient:
    def __init__(self, mcp_endpoint="http://localhost:8000"):
        self.mcp_endpoint = mcp_endpoint

    def project_sync(self, request):
        # Call real QuantConnect MCP server
        response = requests.post(f"{self.mcp_endpoint}/project/sync", json=request)
        return response.json()
```

### Enhanced Agent Capabilities
