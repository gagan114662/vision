    def __init__(self, failure_threshold=5, recovery_timeout=60):
        self.failure_threshold = failure_threshold
        self.recovery_timeout = recovery_timeout
        self.failure_count = 0
        self.last_failure_time = None
        self.state = "CLOSED"  # CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN

    def call_tool(self, tool_name, *args, **kwargs):
        """Execute tool with circuit breaker protection"""
        if self.state == "OPEN":
            if time.time() - self.last_failure_time > self.recovery_timeout:
                self.state = "HALF_OPEN"
            else:
                raise CircuitBreakerOpenError(f"Tool {tool_name} circuit breaker is OPEN")

        try:
            result = self.execute_tool(tool_name, *args, **kwargs)
            if self.state == "HALF_OPEN":
                self.state = "CLOSED"
                self.failure_count = 0
