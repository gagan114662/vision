# Incident Response Runbook (Initial Draft)

## Scope
Applies to MCP outages, data integrity failures, Lean backtest errors, security incidents, and regulatory alerts.

## Triggering Conditions
- Monitoring alerts from Ops agent (latency > threshold, error rate spikes).
- Security Watch flags prompt-injection or credential misuse.
- Compliance Guardian detects missing audit entries.
- Lean backtest failure impacting validation schedule.

## Response Steps
1. **Triage**
   - Ops agent gathers telemetry snapshots, affected tools, recent deployments.
   - Determine severity (SEV1 critical trading impact, SEV2 validation delay, etc.).
2. **Containment**
   - Disable affected MCP tools via registry toggle.
   - If security-related, rotate secrets and revoke sessions.
   - Notify Meta-Supervisor to pause related agent workflows.
3. **Investigation**
   - Analyze logs via SIEM; cross-reference provenance ledger for data anomalies.
   - For Lean issues, inspect Docker logs, config diffs, and dataset freshness.
4. **Remediation**
   - Apply fixes, rerun QA gates (`@qa *review`, `@qa *gate`).
   - Update documentation, root cause notes, and preventive actions.
5. **Communication**
   - Send status updates to Alpha Council, compliance, stakeholders.
   - Record timeline in incident ticket system.
6. **Postmortem**
   - Conduct blameless review within 48 hours.
   - Log action items in backlog; assign owners and due dates.
